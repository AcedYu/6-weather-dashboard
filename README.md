# 6-weather-dashboard
In this project I created a weather dashboard viewing application. The application consists of creating a navigatable dashboard that allows the user to view the weather data. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. It uses the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities.

It contains notable features such as:
- a searchbar connected to the OpenWeather API to search for cities.
- a display of the weather for the current day. It will contain notable features such as:
  - city's name
  - current Date
  - an icon representing the weather conditions (cloudy, sunny, etc.)
  - tempurature
  - humidity
  - wind speed
  - UV index
    - the UV index's value will be inside a container color coded based on the UV index's severity. Green, yellow, and red corresponds to favorable, moderate, or severe.
- a 5-day forecast under the current day's weather. It will contain notable feature such as:
  - date
  - an icon representing the weather conditions (cloudy, sunny, etc.)
  - temperature
  - humidity
- a city viewing history bar that updates as you look through cities
  - clicking a city in the history bar will display the city's weather data
  - city viewing history will save in the browser's local storage
